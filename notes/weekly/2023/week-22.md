# Week 22 - 2023

## Done

* Got typeCheckString working
* Finished Flutter MediaQuery doc
* Started working on Flutter layout doc
* Got import overrides to work

## TODO

## Doug Feedback

* Investors will have trouble grasping the data flow for Iota
* Make sure average investor doesn't think we are selling bullshit
* Need to draft a tech stack that they find familiar and lends credibility
* Terminology too technical, "desugaring" for example
* Market bids require buyers, who is buying?
* Our credentials don't align with the type of people that would tackle these kinds of problems
* No degree and bachelors in CS or formal credentials working in education
* Our beachhead market is grad students but neither of us were grad students
* Figure out best wording on why we parted with previous companies
* Dallas is a good place to start in

## Lucy Feedback

* Not convinced it's easy to define proofs for bug bounties
* How does it make money?

## Iota

* Stop trying to preprocess CST and just use DI to replace import mechanism

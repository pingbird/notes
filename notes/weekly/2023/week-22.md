## Doug Feedback

* Investors will have trouble grasping the data flow for Iota
	* Make sure average investor doesn't think we are selling bullshit
	* Need to draft a tech stack that they find familiar and lends credibility
* Terminology too technical
	* Market bids require buyers, who is buying?
	* Desugaring
* Our credentials don't align with the type of people that would tackle these kinds of problems
	* No degree and bachelors in CS or formal credentials working in education
	* Our beachhead market is grad students but neither of us are
	* But we have both started companies with a lot of success
* Figure out wording on why we parted with previous companies

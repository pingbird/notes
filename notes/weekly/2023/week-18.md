# Week 18 - 2023

## Done

- Got ghcjs working

## TODO

- Practice pitch
* Learn Haskell
* Iota JS backend

## Iota Strategy

* Market is the way to go
	* Obvious revenue model
	* Immediate and long-term incentives on both sides of market
	* User retention through money making
	* Only competitors are cryptocurrencies with shallow proof solving capabilities
	* Hit up old friends for consult
* Need an impressive demo and more focused selling points
	* Good UI for interactive proof solving
	* Come up with some basic DSL grammars
	* Novel approach to referencing / embedding expressions
* Use demo to convince talent to come aboard
	* University professors
	* Advisors from major tech companies
	* Cybersecurity / formal verification labs

## The demo

1. Build Agda (with js backend) for js
2. Create basic rendering library in agda
3. Create vscode plugin that uses iota runtime to evaluate rendering library
4. Use it to implement some fancy grammars

## JS backend 

Figure out how to seamlessly link type checked code with agda parser

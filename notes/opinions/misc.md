# Crypto

At least in a country with a functioning banking system, cryptocurrency is way too slow, full of vaporware, scams, limited regulation, electricity, buggy contracts, NFTs, etc.

The only successful DeFi companies are either convincing consumers to buy into risky financial products or simply facilitating transactions, rarely providing technology that directly improves people's lives.

Not much else too it, blockchain and crypto is C tier.
